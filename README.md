#Keep Me Alive

Keep me alive is a simple taskbar application to help computers not go to sleep with a click of a button.

The application also has property called 'set me free' which will reset the 'keep me alive' enabling your computer to function normally.

Once the application is executed, it starts as a taskbar application.
